# AI_Thumbnail_Generator
AI Thumbnail Generator is a Python-based project that creates multiple engaging video thumbnails and intelligently selects the most relevant one using AI. The tool leverages BLIP for extracting meaningful captions from video frames and CLIP for comparing image–text similarity with video metadata, ensuring that the chosen thumbnail best represents the content. It streamlines the process of generating high-quality, eye-catching thumbnails without manual effort.

The project uses OpenCV, Torch, Transformers, NumPy, and PIL to process videos, generate thumbnails, and score them effectively. By combining vision–language models, it goes beyond simple image extraction and makes thumbnail recommendations that align with the video’s title, description, and theme. Future improvements may include style customization, fine-tuning for specific video categories, and integration with platforms like YouTube for automated workflows.
